## Problem Statement:

1. How have rocket launches trended across time? Has mission success rate increased?

2. Which countries have had the most successful space missions? Has it always been that way?

3. Which rocket has been used for the most space missions? Is it still active?


Skills Used:
The following Excel features were incorporated.
1. Data Cleaning,
2. Data Format,
3. Pivot Table
4. Key Performance Indicator(KPI),
5. Charts (Bar chart, Column chart, Donut Chart )
6. Slicers
7. Filters
8. Dashboard
